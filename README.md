## Abugida
An [abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida) (/ɑːbʊˈɡiːdə, ˈæb-/) is a
writing system where characters/"letters" represent a consonant combined with a
vowel. _Abugida_ pieces use the concept of consonant-vowel combinations to help
guide improvised and chance-composed music.

In an abugida, usually letter forms representing consonants are modified to also
represent an accompanying vowel. Symbols that represent a sound family, plus
modifications to the symbols that represent modifications to the family's base
sound.

_Abugida_ pieces is to use one group of symbols (consonant or vowel — doesn't
matter) to represent some primary aspect of musical sound, chosen by performers
or composers, in advance or extempraneously. The other group of symbols then
represents modifications to the base sound. What the "base sounds" and
"modifications" actually are is open-ended. Some examples might be:

| Consonants | Vowels |
| ---------- | ------ |
| chord root | chord quality (maj, dom7, alt, etc.) |
| starting note | short melodic phrase |
| string | fret |
| synth parameter | parameter value
